    "abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) is a leading technology of the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0 or 4IR), with the capability of incorporating human behavior and intelligence into machines or systems. Thus, AI-based modeling is the key to build automated, intelligent, and smart systems according to today\u2019s needs. To solve real-world issues, various types of AI such as analytical, functional, interactive, textual, and visual AI can be applied to enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application. However, developing an effective AI model is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature and variation in real-world problems and data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on \u201cAI-based Modeling\u201d with the principles and capabilities of potential AI techniques that can play an important role in developing intelligent and smart systems in various real-world application areas including business, finance, healthcare, agriculture, smart cities, cybersecurity and many more. We also emphasize and highlight the research issues within the scope of our study. Overall, the goal of this paper is to provide a broad overview of AI-based modeling that can be used as a reference guide by academics and industry people as well as decision-makers in various real-world scenarios and application domains.",

This is a natural generalization of standard logic in which a concept\u2019s degree of truth, also known as membership value or degree of membership, can range from 0.0 to 1.0. Standard logic only applies to con- cepts that are either completely true, i.e., degree of truth 1.0, or completely false, i.e., degree of truth 0.0. Fuzzy logic, on the other hand, has been used to deal with the concept of partial truth, in which the truth value may range from completely true to completely false, such as 0.9 or 0.5.
