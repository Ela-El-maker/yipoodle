    "abstract": "This project contributes to scholarship extending the traditional scope of rhetorical education. Specifically, this dissertation recovers educational practices and ideas from records documenting the early years of the University of Chicago\u2019s Laboratory School, an experimental elementary school founded and directed by the American pragmatist John Dewey. Researchers have employed John Dewey\u2019s pragmatic philosophy to gain insights into progressive, student-centered composition and rhetoric instruction. However, the field has neglected Dewey\u2019s actual pedagogy as a source for insights into rhetorical education. Using archival analysis methods, this dissertation recovers educational practices from the Laboratory School that were not recognized as rhetorical during their use but which exemplify contemporary definitions of rhetorical practice. Specifically, this study finds that Dewey\u2019s Laboratory School taught literacy and rhetoric and that students\u2019 learning in these areas benefited from the School\u2019s emphasis on embodied learning. By attending to archival records of the Laboratory School, this dissertation demonstrates that Dewey\u2019s own pedagogical practices can inform contemporary thinking about progressive, student-centered composition and rhetoric instruction. In addition, this study suggests that pedagogical techniques tried out in the Laboratory School can inform contemporary thinking about teaching embodied rhetoric. Finally, this work helps to illuminate the value of experimental pedagogies for educators today.",

Finally, while not dissertation related, thank you for always keeping an eye out for interesting projects and writing opportunities for me.

Feminism has been a core part of my identity both personally and academically. When I arrived at the University of Rhode Island in 2012, it was with a cohort of seven other women, and this academic kairos meant that our course material, research interests, and professional development was infused with feminist theory and practice. During coursework, my cohort and I were fortunate to meet with scholars including Cheryl Glenn and Jacqueline Jones Royster, and our own professors regularly contributed to conversations about maternal and material rhetorics.

In his growing theory of pragmatism, Dewey acknowledged the complex and difficult reality of everyday lived experiences and based his philosophy on helping people generate unique and situational problem-solving techniques and mentalities in response. As a whole, pragmatist ethics is marked by a commitment to connecting theory with praxis and is distinctly \u201cnaturalistic, pluralistic, developmental, and experimental\u201d (Seigfried, Pragmatism 7). In these ways, pragmatism seemed to share a fundamental connection to pragmatism, and the features they shared were also those that resonated with me.

As a whole, Progressivism was marked by social and eventually political reform, and various facets of the movement responded to unfolding issues related to gender, race, labor, education, and citizenship. Particularly in urban, industrializing locales, the people active in the movement sought to create the conditions that would allow citizens to function in a democratic society and that responded to what were seen as some of the dehumanizing consequences of industrialization. Specifically, they wanted to promote the ability to work together to solve problems and enact positive change.",

Wilson and Cynthia Lewieki-Wilson explore how exclusion has been an automatic factor of disability for well over 2000 years, and use their work to call into question the binaries of opposition created by the ideas of abled vs. disabled (2). From the embodied rhetoric that Christianity employed by \u201ccasting disability as corporeal testimony of sin and punishment\u201d to the \u201ccries of reverse discrimination, exclusion, or injury\u2026from the seemingly displaced, nondisabled group that identifies itself as the norm,\u201d Wilson and Lewieki-Wilson raise consciousness about critical issues circulating disability studies today (6-15).

The embodied rhetoric involved in creating this plan allows women to advocate for their bodies over time and in situations where they are often ignored (Writing Childbirth 2).

Again, instructors had begun their historio-occupational lessons by introducing students to the basic conditions for human life: shelter, food, clothing and, increasingly, the practices and complications that arose out of meeting these needs. As students examined different historical periods, they considered the day-to-day lives of cultures ranging from early human societies to ancient Phoenicians to Inuit peoples to indigenous Native American tribes to American colonists. They observed how certain fundamental motivations overlapped across time, but also how the unique attributes of a given environment unavoidably shaped the particular practices and habits of a culture.",

Thinking Ahead Reflecting on the work of the Laboratory School suggests possibilities for experimental, embodied pedagogies while providing realistic examples of risks and rewards inherent to such a curriculum. It reminds us that there are no easy answers or absolute guarantees for truly effective pedagogy, but that inherent challenges, risk of failure, and anxiety around unfolding practices are generally assured.
