We find a functional basis to describe the flow, well adapted to the problem of finding the attractor dimension, and which is also used in subsequent direct numerical simulation of these flows. For given Reynolds and Hartmann numbers, we obtain an upper bound for the dimension of the attractor by means of known bounds on the nonlinear inertial term and this functional basis for the flow. Three distinct flow regimes emerge: a quasi-isotropic 3D flow, a non-isotropic three-dimensional (3D) flow, and a 2D flow. We find the transition curves between these regimes in the space parameterized by Hartmann number Ha and attractor dimension $d_\\text{att}$. We find how the attractor dimension scales as a function of Reynolds and Hartmann numbers (Re and Ha) in each regime. We also investigate the thickness of the boundary layer along the bounding wall, and find that in all regimes this scales as 1/Re, independently of the value of Ha, unlike Hartmann boundary layers found when the field is normal to the channel. The structure of the set of least dissipative modes is indeed quite different between these two cases but the properties of turbulence far from the walls (smallest scales and number of degrees of freedom) are found to be very similar.",

INTRODUCTION This paper focuses on \ufb02ows of electrically con- ducting \ufb02uids in channels pervaded by a span- wise (i.e. parallel to the bounding walls, rather than perpendicular as in the more familiar case of Hartmann \ufb02ow) magnetic \ufb01eld with a double aim: 1) to determine the properties of the associated dynamical system, and in particular, an upper bound for the dimension of its attractor, and 2) to derive a functional basis that tightly encompasses the attractor",

In these engineering problems and small scale laboratory experiments, the \ufb02ow falls within the low magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) approxima- tion, where the externally imposed magnetic \ufb01eld is considered constant [2]. Its main e\ufb00ect is then to induce electric eddy currents and a Lorentz force that acts to eliminate variations of velocity along the magnetic \ufb01eld lines. This process has been extensively studied in [3\u20139]. It manifest itself through the presence of very \ufb01ne boundary layers (Hartmann layers) and highly anisotropic struc- tures. The numerical resolution of the bound- ary layers incurs prohibitive computational costs when the magnetic \ufb01elds becomes high.",
