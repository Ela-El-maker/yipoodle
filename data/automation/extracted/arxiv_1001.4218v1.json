What is worse is that the standard inte rpretation of quantum mechanics tells us that we cannot say or even ask anything abo ut the quantum ob- 9 ject between measurements. In this sense, I think, Einstein was right that quantum mechanics is essentially incomplete. It is unrealistic to a ssume that an electron, for example, does not exist between measurements.

But if this were the case, every single electron would behave as an ordinary particle and should go only through one slit and no interference patte rn would be observed on the screen.
