    "abstract": "Mobility disparities among older adults affect their ability to travel and access services. This project seeks to understand challenges, barriers, and gaps that older adults experience, and develop forms of assistance or educational strategies to fill the varying mobility gaps and meet mobility needs. This study characterizes older adults\u2019 use of existing and potential transportation options, including conventional transit, paratransit, and ride-hailing systems, based on surveys collected from 146 low-income older adults in Dallas, TX. Using the survey data and interview data, we develop two mathematical modeling (a Latent Class Cluster Analysis and agent-based modeling (ABM)) and conduct content analysis to understand low-income older adults\u2019 mode choice decisions, adoption likelihoods based on their barriers to existing mobility options, and socioeconomic characteristics. Three primary personas are identified as the voice of the most vulnerable non-driver, community-dwelling older adults. The quantitative mapping of their needs to the transportation options available to them (public transit, paratransit, taxi, ride share, and rides with family and friends) indicates that none of the existing options meets all of their mobility needs. Through the interviews during the pandemic, the research team found that both drivers and non-driver older adults reduced their trip frequency and depended on family and friends for essential needs. In particular, older adults developed their fear of using public transit and paratransit because they were concerned about other passengers not maintaining social distance. One of the noticeable differences is that older adults started to use ride-hailing services and some even preferred it to public transit. Perceptual and knowledge barriers appear to be reduced to adopt ride-hailing although financial and technology barriers still exist. Based on the findings, we discussed several strategies that can potentially reduce observed barriers and challenges and enhance mobility to ultimately increase social equity across transportation-disadvantaged populations, particularly among low-income older adults.",

Access to safe and reliable transportation services is considered the most important factor in determining the livability of a community for older adults (AARP, 2016). However, many older adults, regardless of their socioeconomic characteristics, tend to rely on driving until they are no longer safe behind the wheel since they lack knowledge of or interest in alternative transportation options (Anstey et al., 2006). Public transportation, the second most common alternative for those with or without private vehicle ownership, is considered an affordable transportation mode for particularly low-income older adults.

However, public transit services often lack practicality and convenience for older adults who live in suburban or rural areas (Anderson, 2016). In addition, long walking distances to transit stops, limited operation hours, inflexible schedules and routes, uncomfortable rides, and difficulties in physically entering and exiting the public vehicles are major barriers for older adults to use public transit services (Coughlin, 2001).

Alternatively, low-income older adults may rely on family members or friends for mobility. Although it appears to be the most familiar and convenient mode for older adults who do not drive or do not make regular daily trips, some older adults are disinclined to adopt this option because it makes them feel dependent and beholden to others (Coughlin, 2001).

Since the agent-based modeling describes a system from the viewpoint of its constituent units, the bottom-up modeling approach is the most important feature of ABM (Bonabeau, 2002). The characteristics, interactions, and dynamic behaviors of these constituent units (agents) may cause unpredictable and counterintuitive global system behaviors, which lack rational explanation from the agent- level activities, is called emergent phenomena (Bonabeau, 2002a).

Typically, the statistical parameters AIC and BIC select the optimal number of clusters in LCCA (Vermunt & Migidson, 2002). However, several previous studies pointed out that the optimal number is subject to research objectives and data structures since minimum AIC or BIC values do not always provide meaningful clustering outcomes that distinguish unique behavioral patterns (Molin et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2019).

To respond to such challenges, we were able to identify various coping strategies addressed across the participants and developed four major themes based on the individual, social, and built environments: (1) individual environment: use of technology; (2) social environment: informal support from family and neighbors; (3) social environment: formal support from community organizations for older adults; and (4) built environment: walkable neighborhoods.

Therefore, older adults who lose their ability to drive are unlikely to continue productive social engagement and out-of-home activity, experience a greater dependency on others, and are more likely to develop depression and psychological symptoms (Chihuri et al., 2016; Hwang and Hong, 2018). These civic, social, and economic impacts of driving cessation have stressed the importance for city planners and policymakers to promote and design transportation alternatives for older adults so that they are able to maintain their level of independence and health even after they are unable to drive themselves (Chihuri et al., 2016).",

Personas incorporate the goals, motivations, and other lifestyle choices of older adults, which provides an advantage over market segmentation approaches that focus on grouping older adults solely by demographic factors. The primary personas identified in this study provide a common ground for decision-making by transportation system stakeholders, including government officials, policymakers, funding agencies, land use planners, transportation providers, and designers. Using the primary personas and HOQ enables a systematic design process to identify holistic transportation solutions without car dependency that not only serves non-driver older adults but also can help older adults who",

While technology is unable to replace the emotional satisfaction received from person-to-person contact, it has provided older adults with access to vast resources for learning, entertainment, and physical activity. Additionally, support from community organizations has proved to be vital, keeping older adults informed with resources and services tailored for their needs. Fear of physical injury and personal safety in neighborhoods emerged as a critical factor that can impede older adults\u2019 physical activity and worsen their social isolation.
