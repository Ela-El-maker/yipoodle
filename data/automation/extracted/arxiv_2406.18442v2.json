Introduction Plasma electron density (ne) is a critical lever for fusion performance in tokamaks. High density is necessary for many burning plasma tokamak concepts to maximize fusion triple product nT \u03c4E [1], enhance bootstrap current drive (via steeper density gradients) [2], and enable divertor detachment [3]. There has long been an interest in developing scaling laws to describe the highest achieveable density in tokamaks [4, 5, 6]. Today, the most widely utilized empirical density limit scaling is the \u201cGreenwald limit\u201d [7], expressed as \u00afn nG = 1, (1) where \u00afn is the",

Even infrequent unmitigated disrup- tions - such as once a month - could render tokamak power plants uneconomical given the long timescales needed for repairs [11]. Therefore, tokamak power plants require large safety margins and/or extremely effective control solutions for the density limit and other instabilities. While a complete, first-principles treatment of the density limit remains elusive, theory and experiment have clarified the characteristic dynamics, summarized in Fig. 1. The path to the density limit begins with edge density increasing and/or edge temperature decreasing [12]. Past a certain threshold, a thermal instability occurs at the plasma edge, causing a collapse of the edge temperature. If the plasma is operating",

In L-mode, this temperature collapse is associated with the formation of an X-point radiator or a MARFE - a toroidally symmetric ring of cool, dense plasma on the high-field side [13]. The HDL is not a disruptive instability itself, but can be followed by the \u201cL-mode density limit\u201d (LDL). The LDL occurs when the edge cooling causes the plasma current to concentrate in a peaked current profile [14, 15].

It is expected that burning plasmas will naturally exhibit density peaking due to their low collisionality [28]. Additionally, several studies following Ref.

Generalizing to an unseen device As long as fusion remains an experimental science, data-driven disruption predictors must be robust to \u201cdomain shifts,\u201d i.e. differences between the training set and the cases observed during deployment. The best disruption prediction performances reported in the literature often come from highly expressive machine learning architectures, such as NNs and RFs, which can be especially vulnerable to domain shifts. Given the potentially catastrophic consequences of disruptions during a full-power discharge on ITER [32], robustness to domain shifts is a critical question. Here, we consider an example of a domain shift: training on all AUG, C-Mod, and TCV discharges and then testing on DIII-D discharges. We utilize the",
