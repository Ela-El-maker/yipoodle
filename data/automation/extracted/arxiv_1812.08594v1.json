Quite on the contrary: for example, noncommutative geometry [5] can be seen as such a reversal, and it will be instructive for what follows to examine this example in a bit more detail. Consider a topological space1, called X. Once we have this space, we can look at the continuous real functions on it, denoted C(X).

Noncommutative geometry takes this observation seriously, and uses it to generalize the notion of a \u201cspace\u201d.

But for these and other aspects, I refer the reader to [14]. Instead, let us discuss what a theory of the kind described above would imply for the question of fundamentality and causality. 5 ... and back from matter to mind: a strange loop of fundamentality There is something deeply puzzling about the above: if the mind is more fundamental than the world, then what about our familiar notion of causality? For example, don\u2019t we have a coherent explanation for the kind of technical, information-theoretic content of our brain as a result of the laws of physics? The",

But, by the very de\ufb01nition of what this means , this emergent external world gives an excellent description of what happens to the observer state, since its output con\ufb01guration evolves under the same probabilities as that state.
