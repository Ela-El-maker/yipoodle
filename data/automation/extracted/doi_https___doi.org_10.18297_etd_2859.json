    "abstract": "This thesis analyzes the experiences of Roman Catholic women who joined the Sisters of Loretto, a community of women religious in rural Washington and Nelson Counties, Kentucky, between the 1790s and 1826. It argues that the Sisters of Loretto used faith to interpret and respond to unfolding events in the early nation. The women sought to combat moral slippage and restore providential favor in the face of local Catholic institutional instability, global Protestant evangelical movements, war and economic crisis, and a tuberculosis outbreak. The Lorettines faced financial, social, and cultural pressures\u2014including an economic depression, a culture that celebrated family formation and reproduction, and race-based slavery\u2014that shaped how they executed their benevolent and educational missions over time. The Sisters pursued benevolent and educational missions to serve God and uphold the economic, racial, and gendered social order of the Border South.",

We may not agree on much, but his history seminars and office hours have made me a better scholar, sharper critical-thinker, and stronger speaker. I have been fortunate to work with many talented and student-oriented professors, among whom my thesis advisor, A. Glenn Crothers, stands out as the greatest influence on my academic success. I am thankful for the time my mentor invested to improve my writing, talk through interpretative difficulties, listen to my excessive worries, and write countless letters of recommendation.

It argues that the Sisters of Loretto used faith to interpret and respond to unfolding events in the early nation. The women sought to combat moral slippage and restore providential favor in the face of local Catholic institutional instability, global Protestant evangelical movements, war and economic crisis, and a tuberculosis outbreak. The Lorettines faced financial, social, and cultural pressures\u2014including an economic depression, a culture that celebrated family formation and reproduction, and race-based slavery\u2014that shaped how they executed their benevolent and educational missions over",

However, God\u2019s intentions seemed less clear when tuberculosis swept through the membership between 1820 and 1826. Thirty-four women died, fourteen in 1824 alone. While Christians often interpreted death through their faith, the order\u2019s specific spiritual devotions, centered on empathy with Jesus and Mary\u2019s physical and emotional suffering during the crucifixion, predisposed them to interpret suffering as God-induced. The trauma of witnessing afflicted sisters\u2019 slow, messy, and miserable deaths led survivors to question what they had done for God to inflict such punishment after their hopeful beginnings.",
