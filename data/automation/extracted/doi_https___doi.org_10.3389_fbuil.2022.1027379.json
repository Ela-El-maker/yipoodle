Yet, the traditional methods can be challenging (e.g., time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective) since the conventional methods solely depend on human effort. To overcome such challenges, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has been in use [(Aktan et al., 1996; Housner et al., 1997)]. Brie\ufb02y, SHM is a methodology to examine the health status of civil structures, mostly for large and occasionally medium- sized civil structure systems, by collecting sensorial data with the use of",

In 2014, Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues introduced a generative-based DL model, Generative Adversarial Networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014). The model is a combination of a generative network (G\u03b8) and a discriminative network (D\u03c6) where G\u03b8 takes a random noise dataz and then maximizes the likelihood that the data it generatesG\u03b8(z) or ~x is as similar as possible to the real data x. Subsequently, ~x is fed to the discriminative network (D\u03c6) and also the real data samplex is fed toD\u03c6.
