    "abstract": "Abstract Recent innovations in the smart city domain have led to the proposition of a new mode of transportation utilizing Autonomous Passenger Ships (APS) or ferries in inland waterways. The novelty of the APS concept influenced the cyber risk paradigm and led to different considerations regarding attack objectives, techniques as well as risk management approaches. The main factor that has led to this is the autoremote operational mode, which refers to autonomous operations and remote supervision and control in case of emergency. The autoremote operational mode influences the risk of cyber attacks due to the increased connectivity and reliance on technology for automating navigational functions. On the other hand, the presence of passengers without crew members imposes a safety risk factor in cyber attacks. In this paper, we propose a new cyber risk management approach for managing the cyber risks against cyber physical systems in general and Autonomous Passenger Ships in particular. Our proposed approach aims to improve the Defense-in-Depth risk management strategy with additional components from the Threat-Informed Defense strategy allowing for more evolved cyber risk management capabilities. Moreover, we have utilized the proposed cyber risk management approach for the proposition of a cybersecurity architecture for managing the cyber risks against an APS use case named milliAmpere2. Additionally, we present our results after conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in cybersecurity evaluation in the maritime domain. Then, the findings of the SLR were utilized for a suitable evaluation of the proposed risk management approach. Our findings suggest that our proposed risk management approach named Threat-Informed Defense-in-Depth is capable of enriching several risk management activities across different stages in the system development life cycle. Additionally, a comprehensive evaluation of the cybersecurity posture of milliAmpere2 has been conducted using several approaches including risk evaluation, simulation, checklist, and adversary emulation. Our evaluation has uncovered several limitations in the current cybersecurity posture and proposed actions for improvement.",

The concept of security tiers re\ufb02ects the necessity for implementing security controls to address certain levels of risk. However, the observed works lacked a clear implementa- tion of the DiD strategy for ensuring that all layers of defenses are systematically considered. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the DiD as an architecture framework during cyber- security architecture development. The defense layers are collected from several sources including the DiD guidelines for ICS in [23], DNV [ 31], and BIMCO [ 24]. Additionally, some works in the literature provide valuable artifacts includ- ing candidate non-developmental items (NDIs), architectural elements\u2019 properties, features as well as their interconnec- tions. 2.2 The ATT&CK framework",

      "text": "reason this attack failed is due to a requirement in the vendor management process (Sect. 6.9) to have a countermeasure for spoo\ufb01ng attacks, and indeed, the RV042 has such capability [ 108]. Assuming no such requirement exists, and the gateway doesn\u2019t have such capability. The traf\ufb01c between the two gateways passes an external network that is outside the control of the cybersecu- rity architecture. Therefore, the implemented VPN tunnels implemented using the IPSec protocol shield the ship-to- shore communication from \u201cEavesdrop on Insecure Network Communication\u201d techniques.
