I NTRODUCTION Performing multi-step mobile manipulation tasks, such as pick-and-place tasks, with the mobile base in motion has been shown to be an effective means of reducing execution time [1].

For tasks where multiple objects need to be transported or there are multiple acceptable drop points, the optimal decision may be to change targets entirely.

By comparison, the turn environment presents a very limited manipulation window.

R ELATED WORKS The base-placement problem for mobile manipulation determines a collision-free pose for the robot base from which to perform a manipulation task [11]. Approaches typically aim to generate solutions that are optimal against some other metric such as manipulability [12], [13], or stiffness of the robot [14]. Other approaches aim to minimise task time by calculating base poses from which multiple targets can be reached without repositioning the base between tasks [15], [16]. Time ef\ufb01ciency can be optimised on multi-step tasks by choosing a pose based on where the robot must go after the immediate target [17], [18].

In particular, we desire a system that will perform tasks on-the-move where possible, but slow down or stop when a manipulation failure requires increased time near a target. IV. A PPROACH We divide the base control system into two components: a base placement module and a base controller. A.

By aborting the search and enforcing an update frequency the system achieves real-time reactive control. We have introduced several modi\ufb01cations to the controller presented in [19] to improve its performance in a manipulation on-the-move scenario. 1) Goal Orientation: The most important addition to STAA* is the inclusion of an orientation to the goal state.

All methods share the arm control method presented in [10]. A. Conventional Reactive The \ufb01rst baseline is representative of several reactive controllers for mobile manipulation such as those presented in [20]\u2013[23]. In this baseline, the base placement method proposes the collision-free pose within manipulation range of the object that is closest to the robot\u2019s current position. The base is controlled to",

This is expected, however, it is interesting to note that the magnitude of the improvement is dependent on the task.
