    "abstract": "Pacific populations are becoming younger and this \u2018youth bulge\u2019 is often perceived as a dangerous precursor to civil unrest. Yet young people are also a valuable resource holding exciting potential for the future of island nations. Addressing these conflicting views of youth, this volume presents ethnographic case studies of young people from across the Pacific and the diaspora. Moving beyond the typical focus on \u2018youth problems\u2019 in reports by Pacific governments and development agencies, the authors examine the highly diverse lives and perspectives of young people in urban and rural locations. They celebrate the contributions of youth to their communities while examining the challenges they face. The case studies explore the impacts of profound local and global changes and cover a wide sweep of youth experiences across themes of education, employment and economic inequalities, political and civil engagement, and migration and the diaspora.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nContributors to this volume bring many decades of experience of research with Pacific people as well as fresh perspectives from early career and graduate researchers. Most are anthropologists and their chapters contribute to the interdisciplinary fields of youth studies and Pacific studies, offering thought-provoking insights into the possibilities for Pacific youth as they face uncertain futures.",

The case studies consider the contemporary situation of youth and their uncertain futures, with a stronger focus on social change than the more \u2018traditional\u2019 emphasis of the contributions to the 1998 volume.

In their introduction to Adolescence in Pacific Island Societies, Herdt and Leavitt (1998b) recognised that \u2018adolescence\u2019 is a Western category that is constructed from a specific period of physical and social maturation. Although they use the term throughout their introduction, several of the chapter authors clarify that the category does not fit well for their case studies. In two of the case studies based in Papua New Guinea (PNG) (Biersack 1998; Lepowsky 1998), \u2018youth\u2019 is used instead and is shown to extend into the late 20s. In Rotuma, \u2018youth\u2019",

In this collection, \u2018youth\u2019 is used rather than adolescence, while recognising that there is no widely accepted definition with the Pacific.

This takes the form of life skills training, work-ready training, industry engagement, vocational training and entrepreneurship. In recent years, some Pacific countries have introduced T echnical and Vocational Education and T raining (TVET), but this has met with mixed success due to the widely shared perception that the training is only suited to those performing poorly at school. Although opportunities certainly exist for skilled workers in Pacific countries (Tagicakiverata & Nilan 2018), vocational training is regarded negatively by both parents and young people.

There are exceptions; for example, since 2012, Fiji has introduced outreach training through the Fiji National University, which has operated the Sustainable Livelihood Program. The aim is to provide skills training in rural communities to improve self-sufficiency and create greater economic opportunities, whether through formal or informal wage employment or microenterprise.

Problems with education are often highlighted (see Spencer, Chapter 10, this volume, on Micronesian students), as are health issues such as mental health. In the diaspora, youth can also experience problems that are familiar to other marginalised migrant groups, such as racism, poverty and a lack of avenues for social mobility.

The experiences of most Pacific youth, both in the islands and the diaspora, are not captured by these two extremes because they are the ordinary youth who finish school and move on with their lives, whether in wage labour, entrepreneurial activities or subsistence farming; they marry, have children of their own and make the transition into adulthood. That is to say, the overwhelming majority of Pacific youth make positive contributions to their communities. 7 In Australia, 36 per cent of National Rugby League contracts signed in 2011",

In a prophetic portrait of youth migration to the fledgling capital, he argued: There is a drift of the youth away from the village life into towns like Honiara and Gizo because it is attracting the youth with its entertainment and life in the town.

Second, and related to the first point, part of the reason for the problems that outsider-supported youth initiatives encountered was a lack of local ownership and/or a local champion. The Burns Creek NGO-initiated youth projects were left floating, with little evidence of local support. The incumbent MP for East Honiara, who, like all MPs in Solomon Islands, practised a localised form of politicking, clearly saw no political advantages in cooperating with outsider-led endeavours, nor did outsiders involve him. Third, when MPs strive to move beyond direct, personal benefits and to implement \u2018projects\u2019, such as",

Both MPs and outsiders respond to similar temporal pressures: the four-year electoral cycle and the two- to three- year project timeline. When faced with obstacles, the fall-back position of MPs becomes the provision of \u2018cargo\u2019 or the engaging of the sponsorship of one-off activities, just as outsiders are prone to favour standard form, input-based, sequestered \u2018projects\u2019. The result for both actors is the same: little evidence of broad-based youth development (or, indeed, community development) and a risk of communal conflict.

Globalisation, Capital and the Anthropology of Youth in S\u0101moa The most current scholarship on Samoan youth has focused on youth involvement in sport, as observed most notably in the work of Fa\u2018anofo Lisaclaire Uperesa and Christina Kwauk. In \u2018Seeking New Fields of Labor\u2019, Uperesa details how American football has become a central channel for youth future development and explores the connection between football, the history of US imperialism and how local structures of opportunity have evolved in American S\u0101moa (Uperesa 2014b). At the heart of this process is the ever-present question of American S\u0101moa\u2019s territoriality\u2014 specifically, the uncertainty of American S\u0101moa\u2019s status throughout its history",

It was during deployment, of all places, when Sonny honed his tattooing skill on all-too-willing fellow soldiers who must have felt cavalier in inviting an untrained Samoan to permanently mark their bodies, trusting his cultural acumen alone.

Youth unemployment is high in PNG, with young people in urban areas living day-to-day, often causing opportunistic crime to survive and leading lives without direction.

Placing such an emphasis on performance could indicate that some of these athletes are committing, or have committed, to a foreclosed athletic identity without exploring, or having the opportunity to explore, other avenues away from sports (Doherty et al. 2016; Horton 2014; Price 2007). This is not ideal, as identity foreclosure has been found to intensify the negative psychological effect of poor performances, external criticism, injuries and forced retirement (Clews 2015; Harrison et al. 2011; Hughes PACIFIC",

There are many studies that explore this phenomenon among non-Pacific athletes, but it would be useful to identify effective strategies to deter the development of foreclosed identities among young Pacific athletes in future research. Personal Development Just under half of the participants acknowledged the importance of personal development when defining mental wellbeing. Participants described personal development as the ability to improve themselves and continually achieve new goals. Athletes defined personal development in the context of rugby as well as off-field activities, such as education, spiritual growth and self-confidence.

The holistic and relational way that participants viewed mental wellbeing reaffirms the views of Pacific scholarship that states that Pacific peoples view wellbeing in a holistic way, and it highlights the importance of familial servitude and social belonging for these athletes (Alefaio 2009; Bush et al. 2009; Mila-Schaaf & Hudson 2009; Samu & Suaalii-Sauni 2009; Tamasese et al. 2005).
