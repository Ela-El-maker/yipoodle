Thi s system realizes multi -functions such as data acquisition, data processing and analysis, an d state monitoring and archiving.  In order to achieve multi -point backup, the system uses Alibaba cloud server for data cloud storage.  After two months of testing, the system basically meets the requirements of the system design . The function of real -time data acquisition and data processing and analysis runs stably. Next work, we will continue to perfect system functions and add multiple analysis algorithms.",
