    "abstract": "Achieving gender equality in agricultural development is fundamental to reductions in global poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. African women make important contributions to farming and food systems; however, their efforts are often hindered by inefficient and inequitable allocations of intrahousehold labor and time that render women time poor. Time poverty is a root cause of women\u2019s marginalization in rural Africa and an important area of inquiry for feminist scholarship. While gendered time use and time poverty have been researched in many different contexts and countries in Africa, significant knowledge gaps remain. Most studies consider women\u2019s time use divorced from gendered relations, and overlook children\u2019s contributions. Other factors which may combine to influence women\u2019s time burden but are often overlooked include seasonality, work intensity, household structure and composition, cultural norms, familial relationships and intrahousehold power dynamics. Further, the majority of research on gendered time use and time poverty in Africa uses quantitative methods applied to secondary data, which presents challenges for critically identifying and characterizing the confluence of various intrahousehold dynamics which impact women\u2019s multiple roles, responsibilities, and consequently their work and time. This study adds important nuance to the existing body of research by offering an in-depth, qualitative assessment of intrahousehold labor allocation, time use, and time poverty amongst women, men, and children living in multi-generational, largely polygamous households reliant on peanut-farming in the Kaolack region of Senegal. Data collection took place in February 2020, with 111 individuals in three villages. We find that individual workload correlates with gender and age, but is further determined by the demographic composition of the household, the roles assumed by the individual and other family members, and the individual\u2019s place within the social hierarchy. Women and girls in Kaolack are clearly at more risk of time poverty due to their dual responsibility for reproductive and productive work, especially during the rainy season. Furthermore, women\u2019s workload in particular changes over the life course as they assume different roles in different life stages. As a result, women with older daughters and, especially, daughters-in-law are significantly less time poor than other women.",

Introduction Gender gaps in agriculture are persistent, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (Kristjanson et al., 2015). Many gaps stem from the fact that women in farm households are often overburdened by their responsibilities for both reproductive and productive labor (Arora, 2015). Intra-household distribution of work is \u201cdictated by social norms that put women at a disadvantage\u201d (Arora and Rada, 2017, p. 93); this often results in gendered time poverty (Blackden and Wodon, 2006 ; United Nations, 2020 ), one aspect of the multidimensional nature of poverty in rural Africa (Alkire, 2018).

While time poverty can also be experienced by men ( Lawson, 2008; Soh Wenda and Fon, 2021), many labor-saving innovations in agricultural settings focus on productive activities dominated by male control. Further, Africa has yet to undergo the structural transformations in the household, including domestic labor-saving mechanization, that have taken place in developed countries (Dinkelman and Ngai, 2022). Due to patriarchal social norms, rural African women also have lower levels of time-use agency \u2013 an individual\u2019s ability to determine what they do with their time in order to reach their goals \u2013 which is an important element of empowerment (Eissler et al., 2022).

Cows and goats are the most common livestock; some households also own horses and donkeys for transport and land preparation. Cultivation is overwhelmingly conducted through family labor. Typically, there is a household millet field owned by the head which is used as the basis for family consumption; additional plots planted with peanut or other crops are exploited by individual family members. Adult sons may be given land upon marriage; while Senegalese law acknowledges the right of women to own land, in practice it is rare for women to hold legal title ( Sall, 2010); rather, Marter-Kenyon et al. 10.3389/fsufs.2023.1198290 Frontiers in",

Beyond that, we found quite a lot of evidence that the structure and composition of households matters. Ultimately, much of this comes down to substitution of labor, or the ability to shift responsibilities onto other individuals. Studies conducted in Nigeria and Lesotho ( Lawson, 2008 ; Adeyeye et al., 2021) find that households with a disproportionate number of children and the elderly require more care",

How do social hierarchies between first and subsequent wives influence time use? Third, work intensity and drudgery are critical, overlooked, components of time use and the experience of decent work.

Without a consideration of power, interventions to mitigate the time it takes women to do a certain activity may not in fact reduce their daily number of hours worked or overall workload (Johnston et al., 2018).
