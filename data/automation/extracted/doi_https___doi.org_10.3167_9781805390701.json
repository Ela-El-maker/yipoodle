The key point to take from Gadamer\u2019s work is that risk to fore-meaning is an inherent property of those intellectual exchanges that lead to critical scrutiny and examination of presuppositions. As such, contexts of intellectual exchange necessarily raise important questions about the durability or transformation of subjects\u2019 ethical commitments: an observation which means that intellectual exchange cannot be meaningfully understood aside from an engagement with its participants\u2019 and observers\u2019 ethical and moral lives.

Given that intellectual life is a foundational aspect of human experi- ence which represents a legitimate and fruitful (though by no means the only) point of departure for anthropological enquiry and analysis, there are many good reasons for the notion of \u2018intellectual exchange\u2019 to be front and centre of anthropological vocabulary.

Such traditions are deliberative.

My focus is the ethical entailments of such activities, including those relat - ing to the delineation of Vietnamese national space, and the astrobiological reckonings for which one commissions a geomancer.

Veena Das (2015) explains how names are sites of vulnerability on account of their iterability: a personal name is \u2018both mine and out of my control\u2019 (ibid:. 3). The doomed bids to wrest back control of Kaur in the cases of Leone and Dhillon suggest something of this vulnerability. For brand names, vulnerability comes from the mimetic ability to copy the name and use it for an inferior product, or to take a similar sounding name and thus to steal a part of the name and the market share (Das and Copeman 2015: 11). Kaur/Singh are similarly vulnerable in that their status and function as both personal names and sacred objects",

My concern here has been different but complementary. First, the chapter has sought to show how the exchange of names generates for Sikhs both different forms of exchange value and significant intellectual exchanges. Focused on cherished identifications, these intellectual exchanges are fre- quently both reasoned and emotive, cerebral and volatile.

Gombojab, an extraordinarily precocious, gifted youth, was only thirty-one when he was arrested in 1937; he had no old or even middle age in which to reminisce to descendants. Furthermore, much key docu- mentation, such as his culminating academic work and correspondence, has disappeared.

This chapter re-examines the notion of exchange itself, by demonstrating ways in which hands become simultaneously material and intel- lectual agents, exchanging not only objects but also ideas. Distinctive develop- ments in Western and precolonial Indian philosophical thought, together with anthropological theory, show that hands are peculiar organs with motor (action), sensory (feeling) and cognitive (thought) functions.

Thus, the anthropology of exchange (with hands) is inextricably connected with the anthropology of senses and cognition. Further, precisely due to hands\u2019 original features as being both intensely sensory-embodied and motor-intentional organs, philosophical debates relate them to immanent experiences and dis - tinct human abstractions like the transcendental consciousness, soul and so on.

The lashing small and big rain- drops pouring on different levels, textures and sizes of lotus leaves populating the water-body produce three kinds of sounds, of high, medium and low pitches. The meditating sage is captured by the vibrating variation, and envi- sions reproducing those tonal pitches with hands. He rushes to his ashrama, and describes the sounds to the lord of cosmic construction, Vishwakarma, who manually crafts a clay percussion instrument, its edges plaited with three differentially stretched leather surfaces, replicating the natural tonal rhythms (Bandopadhyay 1995: 164\u201365; Beck 2013; Pande 1996: 285\u201392, 301).

Thus, hands are able to simultaneously engender material exchange in the market, and both sensory and intellectual exchanges among the exchanging agents.

Their work offers valuable insights into the genesis of intellectual traditions. Moreover, by revealing how collective processes of dia- logue and collaboration are integral to the generation and circulation of ideas, such studies displace commonplace narratives of \u2018individual brilliance\u2019 or the \u2018hegemonic imposition\u2019 of epistemological frameworks in favour of more subtle and equitable attributions of responsibility for intellectual developments (see e.g. Lewis 2004; Merkel 2017).

Anthropologists must recognize that the effects associated with the ideal of intellectual exchange can be just as consequential as the practice of transfer - ring of skills, knowledge",

In both cases, feelings of abandonment lend a distinctive affective tenor to international mobility.

Other international study destinations can elicit negative reactions for different reasons. For example, Abaza (1991: 356\u201357) found that Indonesian students at Al-Azhar University in Cairo struggled with the memorization-based learning style, the difficulty of the Qur\u2019anic examination, and the nonchalant attitudes of their Egyptian peers. Meanwhile, Theo (2018: 104\u20135) notes that Indonesian students embarking upon study abroad in China can be beset with anxieties stemming from Cold War-era stereotypes of communism, although she observes that such perceptions are often quickly overturned once in-country. 276 Nicholas J.

Their violent conquest of Vietnam between 1858 and 1885 and their military superiority ensured this. The promulgation of the Indigenous Code in 1881 codified it",

And their actions that day only further widened the gulf between the French and the Vietnamese, convincing many that the only way to change imperial time was by the use of violence. Had the troops been more disciplined, as Peter Dunn has argued, then the mob hysteria that rolled through Saigon that long September day would prob- ably have been averted (Dunn 1945: 196\u201397).
