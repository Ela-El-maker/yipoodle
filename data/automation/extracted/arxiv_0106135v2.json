Such is often the situation for Fe 2+ and Co 3+. For these ions the low-spin (LS) state (occupation of d-levels t 6 2ge0 g, S=0), intermediate-spin (IS) state (t 5 2ge1 g, S=1) and high- spin (HS) state (t 4 2ge2 g, S=2) can be stabilised at di\ufb00erent conditions. In some cases there occur spin-state transitions caused e.g. by change of pressure, temperature or composition.
