INTRODUCTION Excitons are Coulomb-bound pairs of a positively charged hole in the valence band and a negatively charged electron in the conduction band of a semiconductor. Hence, these elementary excitations of a semiconductor are often regarded as the hydrogen analog of the solid state. It is now more than 80 years since Frenkel [1\u2013 3], Peierls [4], and Wannier [5] formulated the concept of excitons. After the experimental discovery of these quasi- particles in cuprous oxide (Cu2O) by Gross and Karryjew in 1952 [6], excitons in bulk semiconductors became an important topic in solid-state physics from the late 1950s to the 1970s (see, e.g., Refs.

By analogy with the interaction of atoms with light one may suppose that absorption of light in a crys- tal can be described as the excitation of an exciton with the simultaneous disappearance of a photon [7]. Indeed, in the weak-coupling limit, the incident light acts only as a perturbation on the di\ufb00erent energy states or excita- tions of the solid like, e.g., excitons [47]. However, since the excited states in the solid are connected with a polar- ization and since an oscillating polarization emits again an electromagnetic wave acting back onto the incident wave, there is an interplay between light and matter.
