These methods are described using different terminologies, such as scenario modeling [20, 53, 61], sensitivity analysis [51, 54], perturbation-based analysis [55], what-if analysis [30, 32, 52, 74, 76], inverse modeling [63, 65, 70], counterfactual analysis [45, 102], and parameter space analysis [ 12, 88]. For example, scenario modeling involves simulating selected potential conditions of factors to evaluate different outcomes [61, 99]. Sensitivity analysis assesses the impact of variations in specific factors on outcomes [9, 25]. Perturbation-based analysis deliberately introduces variations to factors and study system behavior [55]. What-if analysis identifies",

Parameter space analysis systematically examines input variations to observe their effects on outputs [75]. Despite their diverse applications, these seemingly distinct analyses share common conceptual structures and objectives: they all involve exploring hypothetical scenarios to observe potential outcomes or identifying data and model configura- tions that achieve desired outcomes.

However, no work has systematically examined how these analyses relate to one another within a cohesive structure. Specifically, we identify three critical gaps in the current understanding and interpretation of these analyses. First, while different what-if analysis methods address different objectives across domains, the motivations underlying their use have not been articulated clearly in a domain-agnostic manner. Second, there has been insufficient analysis of the fundamental building blocks of what-if analysis\u2014what elements to modify (e.g., data attributes or model parameters) and how to execute the modifications (e.g., dataset scoping, variable perturbation and constraint application, or reweighting in models).",

Third, distinguishing between different types of what-if analysis is often challenging. For example, inverse modeling and counterfactual analysis both trace outcomes back to their inputs, but differ in their implementation strategies, raising questions about whether they constitute distinct methodologies or are merely variations of a common analysis method. These ambiguities hinder systematic advancement in what-if analysis and complicate the development of generalizable analytical tools.

Model Type This refers to the type of model, which can be characterized by several factors: the nature of the output variable (e.g., categorical vs. continuous), the underlying algorithmic family (e.g., tree-based, regression, neural networks), and the specific application context for which what-if analysis is employed. We broadly categorize the models based on whether the model is established or user-defined because it reflects how the model is obtained to use for what-if analysis: (1) Established Models (establishedModel) (75.94%): Most",

But, the main operation enabling SENSITIVITY analysis is the perturb operation, which is used to specify the alterations. Based on the perturbation type (perturbType) described in the earlier section, two approaches of performing the SENSITIVITY what-if analysis can be taken: (1) over Individual Points, when perturbType = pointValue; a single adjustment is applied per input variable or model parameter.
